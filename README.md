Repository to reproduce analyses from Benito et al. **Human practices are behind the aquatic and terrestrial decoupling to climate change in tropical Andes** 

Numerical analyses use recent advances on  [nonlinear estimated rate of change](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa056/5835266), GAMs, and [simulated lagged time-series](https://zenodo.org/record/2599859#.YCTzbGhKiUk) to understand time-varying relationships based on assemblage-wide rate of change of aquatic, terrestrial and human datasets using Lake Llaviucu (Ecuador) as a model system.

### Repository structure
1. **R scripts**: codes for running all the statistical analyses in a logical order
2. **Data**: raw datasets (diatom sediment and training set abundances, lakes' environmental data, and geochemical proxies), and secondary data matrices resulting from primary statistical analyses in <i>R scripts</i>
3. **Figures**: plots resulting from analyses in <i>R scripts</i>
