# DiatPollSync

Initial repository to perform long-term aquatic-terrestrial synchrony analysis.
Numerical analyses use recent advances on  [nonlinear estimated rate of change](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa056/5835266), GAMs, and [synchrony time-series](https://zenodo.org/record/2599859#.YCTzbGhKiUk) to understand couplings between aquatic, terrestrial and human dynamics using Lake Llaviucu (Ecuador) as a model system.
